    1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores

    2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams

    3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
    as parameters ('avgDolphins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
    to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
    Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"

    4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
    Data 2

    5. Ignore draws this time

    Test data:
    ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
    ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

    Hints:
    ยง To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
    ยง To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
    Apply this to the team's average scores`);
